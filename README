The purpose of this web app is to be able to upload an image, and 
store it in Firebase Storage with a reference to the image in Firebase
Database so we can retreive the image later. 

If you decide to connect your own Firebase, you will need to change the 
credentials in "app.js" 

Here's a list of the files and their purpose:
    - index.php: Dynamically lays out the webpage for easy expansion 
                 and deployment with Heroku using the PHP buildpack
    - header.html: Contains the head, title, and css link all pages need
    - landing.html: Contains the content of the page 
    - footer.html: Contains the links to the Firebase Libraries, JQuery, 
                   and the local Javascript files
    - style.css: Styling for the webpage
    - app.js: Connects the app to the Firebase and carries out a set of 
              instructions such as storing the image, and creating a Database 
              reference for it. 

You can find a live deployment of the site here:
